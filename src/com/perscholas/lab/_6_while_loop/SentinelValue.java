    /* Write a program that reads and calculates the
     * sum of an unspecified number of integers. The
     * input 0 signifies the end of the input.
     *
     * If data is not 0, it is added to the sum, and
     * the next input data are read. If data is 0,
     * the loop body is not executed, and the while
     * loop terminates.
     *
     * If the first input read is 0, the loop body
     * never executes, and the resulting sum is 0.
     *
     * Suggested Output
     * ● Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): 2
     * ● Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): 3
     * ● Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): 4
     * ● Enter an int value (the program exits if the input is 0): 0
     * ● The sum is 9
