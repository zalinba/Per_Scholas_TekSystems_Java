     * to a for loop within a for loop. This means that two
     * for-loops are inside each other. They are generally
     * used to print complex patterns on a Java platform.
     * An example of a nested for loop is shown below.
     *
     * Here the class name is PyramidExample. The main() is
     * declared. After that, the two loop control variables
     * are declared. One is the loop control variable “i,”
     * and the other is the loop control variable “j.” Then
     * the “*” is printed in the loop control.
     *
     * The new line is given so that the given format of the
     * pyramid structure is maintained. In this code, the program
     * runs five times. However, by increasing the value of the
     * letter “i” we can make sure that the pyramid is bigger.
