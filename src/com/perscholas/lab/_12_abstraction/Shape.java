//Lab 303.6.3 Abstraction

/* In the previous lab [LAB - 303.6.1], we used examples
 * of Shapes. We created Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle
 * objects. The Shape class can only be used as a superclass
 * for Inheritance and Polymorphism purposes; it cannot be
 * used for objects. The class that is not used for creating
 * objects is known as abstract.
 *
 * Using an abstract class, you can improve the Shape class
 * that was shown in the previous lab [LAB - 303.6.1].
 * Since there is no meaningful concept of area for an undefined
 * two-dimensional shape, the following version of the program
 * declares getArea( ) as an abstract method inside the Shape class.
 * This means that all classes derived from the Shape class must
 * override getArea( ).
 *
 * Remember that we cannot instantiate the Abstract class; so
 * there is not need to create a Constructor in the Abstract class.
 * We will remove the constructor from the Shape class and make a
 * few changes in all subclasses accordingly.
 *
 * Create a class named Shape. This will be an Abstract class and superclass.
