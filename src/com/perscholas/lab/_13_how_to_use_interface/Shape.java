//Lab 303.6.4 How to use Interface

/* In the previous Lab[LAB - 3.6.3 ], we demonstrated
 * that an abstract class has both methods with bodies,
 * and methods with no bodies (abstract methods). You
 * learned that abstract methods must be overridden in a subclass.
 *
 * An Interface is similar to an abstract class with no
 * fields and all abstract methods. Interfaces cannot be
 * instantiatedâ€”they can only be implemented by classes.
 * The purpose of an Interface is to specify behavior for a class.
 *
 * In other words, we can say that an Interface is a design
 * contract. It specifies methods and classes that can "implement"
 * the Interface, and thereby sign the contract.
 *
 * We will use the Shapes example in this Lab.
 *      Suppose that our application involves many shapes that
 *      can move. We could define an interface called movable,
 *      containing the signatures of the various movement methods.
