//Lab 303.10.1 Reading a Delimited File

/* Example 2
 * Let’s make our code more professional, using
 * the concept of “Encapsulation.”
 * Another way of handling a delimited file is
 * by creating something called a Model or Pojo or Entity.
 *
 * A Model is simply a class containing variables with
 * getter() methods and setter() methods, corresponding
 * to each column of the delimited file and containing
 * everything a normal class can contain.
 *
 * Assume that you have ‘course’ information in the form
 * of a CSV file. As a developer, it is your responsibility
 * to extract data from a file, and then display the data
 * in a console. Finally, you import data into the database.
 * This process is called ETL (Extract Transformation Load).
 * Let’s see first how we can extract/read data from a CSV file
 * in a professional way.
 *
 * Click here - Download the Dummy file (CourseData.csv).
 *
 * Create a class named course, and write the code below in
 * that class. This will be our Model class.
