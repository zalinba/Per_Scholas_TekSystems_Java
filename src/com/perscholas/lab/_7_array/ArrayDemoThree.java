         * In the above example, we have created an array of
         * named numbers. We have used them for...each loop
         * to access each array element.
         *
         * Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of each element.
         * Notice the line:
         * int arrayLength = number.length;
         *
         * Here, we are using the length attribute of the array to
         * calculate the size of the array. We then calculate the average using:
         * average = ((double)sum / (double)arrayLength);
         *
         * As you can see, we are converting the int value into a double.
         * This is called "type casting‚Äù in Java.
